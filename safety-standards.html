  <h1>FaceOff 24 Child Safety Standards</h1>

  <p>FaceOff 24 is committed to protecting children from exploitation, abuse, and harmful content. The following policies and practices are in place to ensure our platform is a safe space for all users.</p>

  <h2>1. Zero Tolerance for CSAE</h2>
  <p>We do not permit any content or behavior that sexually exploits or endangers children. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Child sexual abuse material (CSAM)</li>
    <li>Sexualization of minors</li>
    <li>Grooming or predatory behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Reporting & Moderation</h2>
  <p>All users can report inappropriate content or behavior through the in-app reporting tools. Our moderation team reviews reports promptly and takes action, including removal and account suspension or banning.</p>

  <h2>3. Proactive Monitoring</h2>
  <p>We use both automated systems and human moderators to detect and remove content that violates our child safety policies. We also collaborate with relevant law enforcement agencies where necessary.</p>

  <h2>4. Age Restrictions</h2>
  <p>FaceOff 24 is intended for users aged 18 and over. We prohibit underage users from creating accounts, and any suspected underage activity is investigated and removed.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>To report CSAE-related concerns or abuse, please contact us directly at:</p>
